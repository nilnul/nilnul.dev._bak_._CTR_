# nilnul.dev._bak_._CTR_

A library of winform controls to support application: nilnul.dev._bak_._WIN_, which can bak (backup) your local repos to a collection of remote servers, such that you files would never get lost;

nilnul.dev._bak_._WIN_ can
- automatically name your repo if you follow a specified structure; so can just put your repo in a certain location, and this software can handle the rest for you (you even don't need to init it!);
- create corresponding repo on the server;
- create a bak branch in your local repo to keep your work-in-process before pushing it to the servers;
- push also other branches;
- push some branches you named as `pub-*` to the pub servers as you configurated; this is useful if some repo is open source one;

This currently targets dotnet framework 4.8.1;
